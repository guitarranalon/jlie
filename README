Javascript Lite Image Editor
============================

This is a extremely simple image editor based on Caman.js.
I plan to add more features included on Caman (which is no difficult, I know) and, perhaps some new ones.
For the histogram I've used parts of this code: http://www.robodesign.ro/coding/svg-or-canvas/histogram.html
Some jQuery and jQuery UI is also needed.

You may wonder if I've done anything :) Yes! Even more than put everything together (which was not trivial): there is a kind of chain of responsibility for the filters (it's something ;) ).
